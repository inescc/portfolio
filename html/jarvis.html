					<h5>Challenge</h5>
					<p>We use technology everyday to communicate with members of our family, friends and colleagues. We have many communication channels available, from social media to instant message services, email, phone, etc. Having all those systems at our disposal, sharing information should be easier but that is not always the case: we often face communication problems even with the members of our household.</p>
					<p>
					JARVIS is an integrated shared media surface aiming at bringing household members together and helping them organize their daily life.</p>
					<p>
					JARVIS is the result of a thorough user research on information sharing problems encountered in modern-day households.
					</p>
					<p>
					Developed in an iterative manner and integrated in a dining table, JARVIS combines digital with analog tools for sharing information.

							<h5>Research</h5>
							<p>In order to understand who our stakeholders are and what problems our target users encounter in their daily life, we conducted an online survey with 227 participants. Participants indicated three main problems when it comes to sharing information within a household: miscommunication, too many communication channels and the lack of real-time information synchronization. The survey also revealed that household members tend to mostly share information about appointments and location.</p>

						</div>
						<div class="col-8">
							<p> This information is usually shared either digitally through chat, or analogically. Examples of analog tools are notepads and sticky notes. Household members use the kitchen or dining table as a place for the exchange of information.</p>
							<p>As households with roommates proved to be the group that encounters most problems while sharing information, we decided to consider people between 18 to 35 years old who share a home, as our target group.</p>

					<h6>Sandra, good in languages and writing</h6>
					
					<p>Sandra is 21. She is from Greece. She is studying English at the University of Leiden (Netherlands). She speaks Greek, English and Dutch. She sometimes teaches Dutch to international students and spends the little money she gets on travelling, her biggest passion. In her free time, she likes writing on her own blog. She's been blogging about travelling and lifestyle for about 3 years, and about expat life in the Netherlands for 1 year. She would love to make money with her publications. However, she thinks she first needs to make the design of her blog more appealing. Her greatest frustration is not being able to customize her blog by herself. She's been helped a couple of times by her room-mate Aldo, who is a programmer. She doesn't want to ask him everytime she needs to change something so she's trying to learn programming through an online course. However, she really struggles to understand. </p>

					<h6>Peter, knows many programming languages</h6>
					
					<p>Peter is 21. He is from the Netherlands. He studies Computer Science at the Technical University of Delft. He is very good at programming and builds websites for friends. He normally does it for free, as a favour. He spends his free time playing videogames or watching gamers online. He would really like to become a professional gamer. His second life dream, which he thinks is more realistic, is starting his own game development company with his best friend Bas. He would like to spend more time thinking on the idea and creating a business plan, but he is very busy with all his courses. Specially, paper writing takes up most of his time, as he is not very skilled. That frustrates him as he would rather spend time programming, gaming or working on his own company.</p>

					<h5>Interaction Design</h5>
					<p>Users first need to create an account to interact with the platform. In their profile, they can list the skills they would like to offer and their availability. Every user starts with 1-hour credit. To find potential assignees, users can browse through the homepage or use the search bar and filters to look for specific skills.</p>
					<p>To assign a user to a certain task, the assigner should click on the <em>assignme</em> button on the assignee's profile page. That would open a direct message window to the potential assignee, where both users can negotiate the duration of the assignment.</p>
					<p>After an assignment has been completed, the assignee will get credits for the number of hours invested. Similarly, the assigner will get his or her credit reduced. The assigner will be asked to leave a review to the assignee, that will appear on his or her profile.</p>
